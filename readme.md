Commit#14 - Day 15- Local Storage and Event Delegation

1. Learnt how to store objects and their values using  json string in the LocalStorage of the Browser so the values persist even if the file is closed and opened later on
2. Learnt Event Delgation. If an html element on the page is dynamically created and it has event listeners, the better way to add listeners to it is to add listeners to the parent element. And inside the listener function check if the e.target.matches('input') means if the event has been raised by our required element . in our case 'inputs' . if not just return the function. so the advantage is , no matter if the children of the parent element are being created, modified or deleted dynamically. As long as the parent of the children exist, the parent has the responsibility of invoking the reqd function when the situation demands it.

Commit #21 - Day 25 - Event capture , propagation , bubbling, once
Total time spent: 45 mins

Things learnt:

1. When capture is true, the event propagates from top to bottom
and capture is set to false, the event bubbles up from bottom to top.
Remember capture is top to down
and Bubbling is bottom to top. so if you want to stop propagation of the bubbling at the initial stage
or at any stage you want, just use e.stopPropagation() where e is the event parameter.
2. using once : true inside addEventListener is equal to putting removeEventListener
